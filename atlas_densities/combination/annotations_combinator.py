"""
Module responsible for the combination of different annotation files.

An annotation file is a volumetric nrrd file (voxellized 3D image) whose
voxels are 'annotated', i.e., voxels are assigned integer identifiers defining brain regions.
The hierarchy of brain regions and their identifiers are described in the ontology structure graph.
This graph is provided as a file with json format, often referred to as the hierarchy.json file.

Annotations combination is the process by which a more recent annotation file
(say, annotation/ccf_2017/annotation_10.nrrd) is combined with less recent annotation files
(say, annotation/ccf_2011/annotation_10.nrrd) because some regions are missing
in the more recent file.

Annotations combination was introduced when AIBS released their CCF v3 Mouse Atlas in 2017,
whose annotation file has missing regions with respect to the CCF v2 Mouse Atlas of 2011.
So far, annotations combination handles only to this use case.

    The ccfv2 fiber annotation file is required because fiber tracts
    are missing from the ccfv2 brain annotation file,
