def average_densities_to_cell_counts(

    """
    Create a data frame with the same index as `average_densities` (region names) and with two
    columns for each cell type, one column for the cell count, one column for the associated
    standard deviation. In other words, the content of the columns T and T_standard_deviation of
    each cell type T represented in `average_densities` (e.g. T = "pv+") are replaced by cell
    counts and their standard deviations.

    Args:
        average_densities: a data frame whose columns are described in
            :func:`atlas_densities.densities.fitting.linear_fitting`. It contains the average
            cell densities of brain regions and their associated standard deviations. Columns are
            labelled by T and T_standard_deviation for various cell types T.
        region_volumes: the data frame returned by
            :func:`atlas_densities.densities.utils.compute_region_volumes`.
            The volumes to be used are stored in the "volume" column.


    Note: Volumes can refer to volumes of entire regions, including all descendants
        subregions, or volumes of single region identifiers, depending on the value of the
        option `with_descendants` used when creating `region_volumes`.

    Returns:
        data frame containing the cell counts of brain regions and their associated standard
        deviations. The data frame index is `average_densities.index` (brain region names) and
        with a pair of columns labeled by T and T_standard_deviation for each cell type T
        represented in `average_densities` (e.g., T = "pv+", "inhibitory" or "sst+"). Column
        labels are lower cased.
