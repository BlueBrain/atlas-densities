    """
    Compute the overall cell density based on Nissl staining and cell counts from literature.

    The input Nissl stain intensity volume of AIBS is assumed to be depend linearly on the cell
    density (number of cells per voxel) when restricted to a mouse brain region.
    It is turned into an actual density field complying with the cell counts of several
    regions.

    The input array `nissl` is modified in-line and returned by the function.

    Note: Nissl staining, according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissl_body, is a
    "method (that) is useful to localize the cell body, as it can be seen in the soma and dendrites
    of neurons, though not in the axon or axon hillock." Here is the assumption on Nissl staining
    volume, as written in the introduction of
    "A Cell Atlas for the Mouse Brain" by C. Ero et al., 2018", page 3:
    "We assumed the stained intensity of Nissl and other genetic markers to be a good indicator
    of soma density specific to the population of interest, without significantly staining axons
    and dendrites."

    Args:
        region_map: object to navigate the mouse brain regions hierarchy.
        annotation: an integer array of shape (W, H, D) which encloses the AIBS annotation of
            the whole mouse brain. The integers W, H and D are the integer dimensions of the array.
        voxel_volume: the common volume of a voxel associated to any of the input arrays.
        nissl: float array of shape (W, H, D) with non-negative entries. The input
            Nissl stain intensity.

    Returns:
        float array of shape (W, H, D) with non-negative entries. The returned array is a
        transformation of `nissl` which is modified in-line. It represents the overall mouse brain
        cell density, expressed in number of cells per mm^3. It is compliant with several
        region-specific cell counts provided by the scientific literature as well as the Purkinje
        layer constraint of a constant number of cells per voxel.
