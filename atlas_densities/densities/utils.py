    Find inside a box the closest point to a line with prescribed coordinate sum.

    This function aims at solving the following (convex quadratic) optimization problem:

    Given a sum S >= 0.0, a line D in the non-negative orthant of the Euclidean N-dimensional
    space and a box B in this orthant (an N-dimensional vector with non-negative coordinates),
    find, if it exists, the point P in B which is the closest to D and whose coordinate sum is S.

    The point P exists if and only if the coordinate sum of B is not less than S.
    The proposed algorithm is iterative and starts with the end point of a direction vector of D.
    First, we uniformly rescale the point coordinates so that it belongs to the plane
     defined by the equation 'coordinate sum = S'. Second, we project the new point on the box
    boundary. The algorithm iterates the two previous steps until we get sufficiently close to B.

    Note: The convergence to the optimal solution is obvious in 2D, but can already fail in 3D.
    At the moment, the function only returns a feasible point.

        line_direction_vector: N-dimensional float vector with non-negative coordinates.
        upper_bounds: N-dimensional float vector with non-negative coordinates. Defines the
            box constraining the optimization process.
        sum_constraint: non-negative float number. The coordinate sum constraints imposed on
            the point P we are looking for.
        threshold: non-negative float value. If the coordinate sum of the current point
            is below `threshold`, the function returns the current point.
        max_iter: maximum number of iterations.
        copy: If True, the function makes a copy of the input `line_direction_vector`. Otherwise,

    Returns: N-dimensional float vector with non-negative coordinates. The solution point of the
        optimization problem, if it exists, up to inaccuracy due to threshold size or early
        termination of the algorithm. Otherwise, a point on the boundary of the box B defined by
