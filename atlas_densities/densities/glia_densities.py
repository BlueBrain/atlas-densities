    Compute the overall glia cell counts per voxel using a prescribed total glia cell count and

        * voxels lying both in the Cerebellum and in the Purkinje layer are assigned zero
            cell counts.

        group_ids: dictionary whose keys are group names and whose values are

            with maximum density (fiber tracts) and those of zero density (Purkinje layer).

    Compute the overall glia cell density as well as astrocyte, olgidendrocyte and microglia

        * It is bounded voxel-wise by the specified overall cell density.
        * It sums up, after multiplication by the voxel volume, to a cell count matching the total
            cell count times the prescribed glia cell type proportion.

    Args:
        region_map: object to navigate the mouse brain regions hierarchy.
        annotation: an integer array of shape (W, H, D) which encloses the AIBS annotation of the
            whole mouse brain.
        voxel_volume: the common volume of a voxel associated to any of the input arrays.
        glia_cell_count: overall glia cell count (taken for instance from the scientific
            literature).
        cell_density: float array of shape (W, H, D) with non-negative entries. The overall
            cell density of the mouse brain expressed in number of cells per mm^3.
        glia_intensities: dict whose keys are glia cell types (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes,
            microglia) and whose values are the unconstrained glia cell densities corresponding to
            these types. Each density array is a float array of shape (W, H, D) with non-negative

            marker datasets.
        glia_proportions: a dict whose keys are glia cell types and whose values are strings
            encoding glia cell type proportions. These are float values in the range [0.0, 1.0]
            which sums up to 1.0.

        The overall glia density field is bounded by the `cell_density` field.
        It sums up to `glia_cell_count` after multiplication by the voxel volume. In
        addition, it respects some region-specific hints (fiber tracts and Purkinje layer).
        For every glia cell type, the correspondging output density field is bounded by the overall
        glia density field and sums up to its prescribed cell count when multiplied with by the
        voxel volume.
