"""Functions to create volumetric neuron densities for the following inhibitory neuron types of
the mouse brain:
- PV+
- SST+
- VIP+
- GAD67+ (a superset of the union of the previous three)

The algorithm is presented in "Atlas of inhibitory neurons in the mouse brain" by D. Rodarie et
al., to appear in <journal>.

This code supersedes the ``refined_inhibitory_neuron_densities`` module, which is maintained to
allow comparisons with the former approach of the same article.

The main function resolves a linear program which aims at minimizing the absolute differences
between output cell counts and input estimates while enforcing the consistency of cell count sums
across the brain region hierarchy.

The file ``doc/source/bbpp82_628_linear_program.pdf`` serves as a documentation of the linear
program, see Section 2 in particular. The initalization of the linear program relies on average
density estimates, obtained obtained for instance via the ``fitting`` module. We refer to these
estimates as the initial estimates.

The output are volumetric density nrrd files, one for each of the aforementioned inhibitory
neuron types. Volumetric densities are derived from the cell counts obtained as the solution of
the previous linear program.

A note on the linear program:

The variable ``x_result`` used in this module is a container for the output cell counts.
It encompasses the variables ``x_{i, m}`` defined in Section 2 of
``bbpp82_628_linear_program.pdf``. The variable ``x_result`` is initialized with the estimates
which are taken for certain (when the "confidence" numbers ``sigma_{i, m}`` are close to 0.0)
and with NaN otherwise. If ``x_result.at[(id_, marker)]`` is set to NaN, then a decision variable
``x_{i, m}`` is introduced where i = id_ and m = marker. Once the program is resolved,
``x_result.at[(id_, marker)]`` is set with the solution value of ``x_{i, m}``. Similarly, the
variable deltas used in this module corresponds to the decision variables ``delta_{r, m}`` of
the pdf file.

    Create the linear program variables `x_result` (cell counts) and `delta`
    (distances to initial estimates) and set the cell counts in `x_result` when those are known with
    certainty.

    The general rule is that if the standard variation associated to a cell count value from
    `region_counts` is (close to) 0.0, the output cell count is set with its initial estimate.
    This corresponds for instance to cell counts within regions known to contain only
    inhibitory neurons (the "known" overall neuron density can then be used) are known to
    contain no inhibitory cells, in which case subtype cell counts are set to 0.0.

            :fun:`densities.inhibitory_densities_helper.average_densities_to_cell_counts`.

            :fun:`densities.inhibitory_densities_helper.average_densities_to_cell_counts` but
            indexed by unique integer region identifiers instead of region names.
            Cell counts are limited to 3D regions defined by a single integer identifier.
            Descendants subregions are therefore not included.

    Returns: a pair (x_result, deltas) which is container for the variables of the linear program.

            identifiers, a. k. a., labels.
        deltas: data frame corresponding to the variables of the linear programs.
            These variables represent the absolute values of the differences between the cell
            count variables and their initial estimates. The linear program attempts to minimize a
            weighted sum of the `deltas`. The `deltas` data frame has one column for each cell

            given for certain (standard deviation close to 0.0), with `SKIP` if no estimate
            is available and with `KEEP` otherwise. The latter case corresponds to a variable

    """
    Create a 3D float array for each cell type that labels a column of `average_densities`.

    Voxel values are cell density values expressed in number of cells per mm^3.
    For a given `annotation` array, a non-zero annotated voxel belongs to an "atomic" 3D region
    whose label is either a leaf of the brain region hierarchy tree or, more surprisingly, not a
    leaf when annotation failed to be more precise. See
    https://community.brain-map.org/t/how-to-interpret-3d-regions-which-are-labelled-by-non-leaf-identifiers-of-1-json/1159
    for discussion on AIBS annotation issues.

    This function computes new cell count estimates based on the initial estimates of
    `average_densities`. This is done by solving a linear program which enforces cell counts
    consistency:
    - the inhibitory neuron count in a region is at least the sum of counts of inhibitory cell
        subtypes under consideration;
    - each neuron subtype count does not exceed the overall cell count prescribed by
        `neuron_density`.

    The linear program minimizes the distances of each cell count to its initial
    estimate when it exists while enforcing the aforementioned consistency.
    The objective function is the sum of the distances to available region cell count estimates
    weighted by the inverses of the associated standard deviations.

    See "Atlas of inhibitory neurons in the mouse brain" by D. Rodarie et al., to appear in
    <journal> for a detailed description of the algorithm.

    Note:
        The density values of regions which are not listed in `average_densities` are
        set to 0.0. Idem for regions whose initial estimates contain a NaN value.

    Args:
        hierarchy: dict holding the tree of the brain regions hierarchy. Children regions
            are accessed via the "children" attribute. (dict counterpart of 1.json or
            hierarchy.json)
        annotation: int array of shape (W, H, D) holding the annotation of the whole
            brain model. (The integers W, H and D are the dimensions of the array).
        voxel_volume: volume of a voxel expressed in mm^3. The input volumetric data (annotation
            and neuron density) are assumed to have voxels of the same dimensions.
        neuron_density: non-negative float array of shape (W, H, D). This array holds the
            volumetric neuron density of the brain model expressed in number of neurons per mm^3.
        average_densities: a data frame whose columns are described in
            :func:`atlas_densities.densities.fitting.linear_fitting` containing the average
            cell densities of brain regions and their associated standard deviations. Columns are
            labelled by T and T_standard_deviation for various cell types T. The index of
            `average_densities` is a list of region names.

    Returns:
        a dict whose keys are cell types (e.g., "gad67+", "pv+", "sst+" and "vip+") and whose
        values are float arrays of shape (W, H, D) holding the cell density of each cell type
        expressed in number of cells per mm^3.

    Raises:
        AtlasDensitiesError if some inconsistency in the input data has been detected or if the
        linear program cannot be solved.
