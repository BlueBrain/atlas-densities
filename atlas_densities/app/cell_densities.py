"""Generate and save cell densities

A density value is a non-negative float number corresponding to the number of cells in mm^3.
A density field is a 3D volumetric array assigning to each voxel a density value, that is
the mean cell density within this voxel.

In BBP terminology, a density field is often referred to as a volumetric density array.

This script computes and saves the following cell densities under the form of density fields.

* overall cell density
* overall glia cell density and overall neuron density
* among glial cells:
    - astrocyte density
    - oligodendrocyte density
    - microglia density
* among neuron cells:
    - inhibitory neuron (a.k.a GAD67+) density:
        - PV+ density
        - SST+ density
        - VIP+ density
    - excitatory neuron density

Note: if M is a gene marker (e.g., GAD67), then M+ denotes the cells reacting to M (e.g., GAD67+).

Density estimates are based on datasets produced by in-situ hybridization experiments of the
Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS). We used in particular AIBS genetic marker datasets and
the Nissl volume of the Allen Mouse Brain Annotation Atlas.
Genetic marker stained intensity and Nissl stained intensity are assumed to be a good indicator
of the soma density in a population of interest.

It is assumed throughout that such intensities depend "almost" linearly on the cell density when
restricted to a brain region, but we shall not give a precise meaning to the word "almost".

The implementation of this module is based on the methods of
- 'A Cell Atlas for the Mouse Brain' by C. Eroe et al., 2018,
- 'Atlas of inhibitory neurons in the mouse brain' by D. Rodarie et al., 2021,
and the code provided by the authors.

    annotated files.

    - ``measurement_unit`` (str), see measurement units below
    - ``comment`` (str), a comment on how the measurement has been obtained
    - ``source_title`` (str), the title of the article where the measurement can be exracted
    - ``specimen_age`` (str, e.g., '8 week old', 'P56', '3 month old'), age of the mice used to
    obtain the measurement

    The different measurement types are, for a given brain region R and a given cell type T:

    \b
    - ``cell density``, number of cells of type T per mm^3 in R
    - ``cell count``, number of cells of type T in R
    - ``neuron proportion``, number of cells of type T / number of neurons in R
    (a cell of type T is assumed to be a neuron, e.g., T = GAD67+)
    - ``cell proportion``, number of cells of type T / number of cells in R
    - ``cell count per slice``, number of cells of type T per slice of R

    Measurement units:

    - ``cell density``: 'number of cells per mm^3'
    - ``neuron proportion``: None (empty)

    Estimate average cell densities of brain regions in `hierarchy_path` for the cell types
    marked by the markers listed in `gene_config_path`.

    We perform a linear fitting based on average cell densities inferred from the scientific
    literature (`average_densities_path`) to estimate average cell densities in regions where
    no record is available.

    In addition to the records from the scientific literature, we consider as input of our fitting
    the average densities of the brain regions where neurons are either all inhibitory or all
    excitatory. These regions are listed in `homogenous_regions_path`. The volumetric density
    `neuron_density_path` is used to compute the average density of inhibitory neurons (a.k.a
    gad67+) in every homogenous region of type "inhibitory".

    Our linear fitting of density values relies on the assumption that the average cell density
    (number of cells per mm^3) of a cell type T in a brain region R depends linearily on the
    average intensity of a gene marker of T. The conversion factor is a constant which depends only
    on T and on which of the following three groups R belongs to:

    \b
    - isocortex
    - cerebellum
    - the rest

    (For each cell type T, there are hence three linear fittings.)

    The cerebellum was singled out because of its very high cell densities wrt the rest of the
    mouse brain. The isocortex was singled out because its layer densities and cell type
    compositions are quite similar across its subregions.

    Each fitted density value of `fitted_densities_output_path` comes along with standard
    deviation.

    The standard deviations are computed differently depending on whether the output value is a
    record from the scientific literature or it has been produced by applying the fitted linear
    map to an average gene marker intensity - we call it a fitted value.
    In the first case, the deviation is the standard deviation attached to the initial and unchanged
    density in `average_densities_path`. In the second case the deviation equals the fitted value
    times the standard deviation of the linear fitting.

    Notes:

    \b
    - 2D points for which the average marker intensity or the average cell density or is 0.0 are
    filtered out before fitting.
    - some regions can have NaN density values for one or more cell types because they are not
    covered by the selected slices of the volumetric gene marker intensities.

    Create volumetric cell densities of brain regions in `hierarchy_path` for the cell types
    labelling the columns of the data frame stored in `average_densities_path`.

    This function support the use case of "Atlas of inhibitory neurons in the mouse brain" by
    D. Rodarie et al., 2021. The densities to be computed in this case are those of GAD67+
    (inhibitory neurons) and those of the inhibitory neuron subtypes PV+, SST+ and VIP+.

    The function modifies the estimates in `average_densities` (the "first estimates" of the paper)
    to make them consistent accross cell types: the average density of GAD67+ cells in a leaf
    region L should be at most the sum of the average densities of its subtypes under scrutiny
    (e.g. PV+, SST+ and VIP+) and should not exceed the neuron density of L.

    Two algorithms can be used:

    - keep-proportions:

        Whenever possible, modified densities are kept in the range [initial value - std deviation,
        initial value + std deviation] for the standard deviations specified in `average_densities`
        The proportions of the initial subtype densities are also preserved whenever possible.

    - linprog:

        A linear program minimizes the distances between the output densities and the initial
        estimates from `average_densities`  while enforcing the consistency of average densities
        across cell types. See :download:`pdf file <bbpp82_628_linear_program.pdf>` in the
