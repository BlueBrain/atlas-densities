=============

The project `atlas-densities` offers tools to create volumetric cell densities 
for the rodent brain. Density `nrrd`_ files are used to `place cells`_ in brain regions with 
prescribed distribution in the context of `circuit building`_.

Tools are made available through a :ref:`cli`.
